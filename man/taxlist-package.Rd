\title{taxlist: Handling taxonomic lists.}
\description{
The class \linkS4class{taxlist} is defined in this package using the
S4 language.
The main task of \code{taxlist} objects is to keep the taxonomic coherence of
information included in taxonomic lists and to implement functions (methods)
for a proper data handling.
Objects of class \linkS4class{taxlist} can be included in further
objects, for instance in biodiversity records as done in the package
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegtable}{vegtable}.
