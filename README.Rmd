## Introduction

`taxlist` is a package designed to handle and assess taxonomic lists in **R**,
providing an object class and functions in `S4` language.
The homonymous object class `taxlist` was originally designed as a module for
taxa recorded in vegetation-plot observations (see
[`vegtable`](https://github.com/kamapu/vegtable)), but became as an independent
object with the ability of contain not only lists of species but also synonymy,
hierarchical taxonomy, and functional traits (attributes of taxa).

The main aim of this package is to keep consistence in taxonomic lists (a set of
rules are checked by the function `validObject()`), to enable the
re-arrangement of such data, and to statistically assess functional traits and
other attributes, for instance taxonomy itself (function `tax2traits()` set
taxonomic information as trait).

While this package only includes a function for the import of taxonomic lists
from [Turboveg](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg), almost any data
source can be structured as `taxlist` object, so far the information is
imported into data frames in an R session and the consistency rules are
respected (validity).

The use of `taxlist` is recommended for people cleaning raw data before
importing it to relational databases, either in the context of taxonomic work
or biodiversity assessments.
The other way around, people having relational databases or clean and
structured taxonomic lists may use `taxlist` as recipient of this information
in R sessions in order to carry out further statistical assessments.
Finally, the function `print_name()` makes `taxlist` suitable for its
implementation in interactive documents using `rmarkdonw` and `knitr` (e.g.
reports, manuscripts and check-lists).

The structure of `taxlist` objects is inspired on the structure of data handled
by [Turboveg](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg) and relational
databases.

## Installing taxlist

This package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**)
and can be directly installed within an R-session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("taxlist", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Alternatively, the current development version is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kamapu/taxlist) and can be installed using the
package `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/taxlist", build_vignette=TRUE)
```

A vignette is installed with this package introducing to the work with
`taxlist` and can be accessed by following command in your R-session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("taxlist-intro")
```

## Building taxlist Objects

Objects can be built step-by-step as in the following example. For it, we will
use as reference the "Ferns of Chile" (original in Spanish: "Helechos de Chile")
by **Gunkel (1984)**.
We will create an empty `taxlist` object using the function `new()`:

```{r}
library(taxlist)

Fern <- new("taxlist")
Fern
```

Then we have to set the respective taxonomic ranks. In such case, the levels
have to be provided from the lowest to highest hierarchical level:

```{r}
levels(Fern) <- c("variety","species","genus")
```

For convenience, we start inserting taxa with their respective names in a
top-down direction. We will use the function `add_concept()` to add a new
taxon. Note that the arguments `TaxonName`, `AuthorName`, and `Level` are
used to provide the name of the taxon, the authority of the name and the
taxonomic rank, respectively.

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern, TaxonName="Asplenium", AuthorName="L.", Level="genus")
summary(Fern, "all")
```

As you see, the inserted genus got the concept ID **1** (see `TaxonConceptID`
in the previous figure).
To insert a species of this genus, we use again the function `add_concept()`,
but this time we will also provide the ID of the parent taxon with the argument
`Parent`.

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern, TaxonName="Asplenium obliquum", AuthorName="Forster",
	Level="species", Parent=1)
summary(Fern, "Asplenium obliquum")
```

In the same way, we can add now two varieties of the inserted species:

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern,
	TaxonName=c("Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides",
		"Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum"),
	AuthorName=c("(Kunze) Espinosa",
		"(Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg"),
	Level="variety", Parent=c(2,2))
```

You may have realized that the function `summary()` is applied to provide on
the one side a display of meta-information for the whole `taxlist` object, and
on the other side to show a detail of the taxa included in the object. In the
later case adding the keyword `"all"` as second argument, the summary will show
a detailed information for every taxon included in the object.

```{r}
summary(Fern)

summary(Fern, "all")
```

## From data frame to taxlist

A more convenient way is to create an object from a data frame including both,
the taxon concepts with their accepted names and the taxonomic ranks with
parent-child relationships.
In the case of the last example, the required data frame looks like this one:

```{r}
Fern_df <- data.frame(
		TaxonConceptID=1:4,
		TaxonUsageID=1:4,
		TaxonName=c("Asplenium", "Asplenium obliquum",
				"Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides",
				"Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum"),
		AuthorName=c("L.", "Forster", "(Kunze) Espinosa",
				"(Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg"),
		Level=c("genus", "species", "variety", "variety"),
		Parent=c(NA, 1, 2, 2),
		stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Fern_df
```

This kind of tables can be written in a spreadsheet application and imported to
your R session.
The two first columns correspond to the IDs of the taxon concept and the
respective accepted name. They can be custom IDs but are restricted to integers
in `taxlist`.
For the use of the function `df2taxlist()`, the two first columns are
mandatory.
Also note that the column **Parent** is pointing to the concept IDs of the
respective parent taxon.
To get the object, we just use the `df2taxlist()` indicating the sequence of
taxonomic ranks in the argument `levels`.

```{r}
Fern2 <- df2taxlist(Fern_df, levels=c("variety", "species", "genus"))
Fern2
```

## Similar Packages

The package `taxlist` shares similar objectives with the package
[`taxa`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa), but uses different approaches for
object oriented programming in **R**, namely `taxlist` applies **S4** while
`taxa` uses **R6**. Additionally, `taxa` is rather developer-oriented, while
`taxlist` is rather a user-oriented package.

In following cases you may prefer to use `taxlist`:

- When you need an automatic check on the consistency of information regarding
  taxonomic ranks and parent-child relationships (parents have to be of a
  higher rank then children), as well as non-duplicated combinations of names
  and authors. Such checks are done by the function `validObject()`.
- When you foresee statistical assessments on taxonomy diversity or taxon
  properties (chorology, conservation status, functional traits, etc.).
- When you seek to produce documents using **rmarkdown**, for instance guide
  books or check-lists. Also in article manuscripts taxonomic names referring
  to a taxon concept can easily get formatted by the function `print_name()`.
- When importing taxonomic lists from databases stored in
  [**Turboveg 2**](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg).
- When you seek to implement the package
  [`vegtable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegtable) for handling and
  assessing biodiversity records, especially vegetation-plot data. In that
  case, taxonomic lists will be formatted by `taxlist` as a slot within a
  `vegtable` object.


## Rmarkdown Integration

As mentioned before, `taxlist` objects can be also used for writing rmarkdown
documents (see [this poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36713.90728)).
For instance you can insert your objects at the beginning of the document with a
hidden chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(taxlist)
data(Easplist)
```
````

To mention a taxon, you can write in-line codes, such as
<code>&grave;r print_name(Easplist, 206)&grave;</code>, which will insert
`r print_name(Easplist, 206)` in your document (note that the number is the ID
of the taxon concept in `Easplist`).
Fort a second mention of the same species, you can then use
<code>&grave;r print_name(Easplist, 206, second_mention=TRUE)&grave;</code>,
which will insert `r print_name(Easplist, 206, second_mention=TRUE)` in your
text.


## Descriptive Statistics

Information located in the slot **taxonTraits** are suitable for statistical
assessments.
For instance, in the installed object `Easplist` a column called
**lf_behn_2018** includes a classification of macrophytes into different life
forms.
To know the frequency of these life forms in the `Easplist`, we can use the
function `count_taxa()`:

```{r}
# how man taxa in 'Easplist'
count_taxa(Easplist)

# frequency of life forms
count_taxa(~ lf_behn_2018, Easplist)
```

Furthermore, taxonomic information can be also transferred to this slot using
the function `tax2traits()`.
By this way we will make taxonomic ranks suitable for frequency calculations.

```{r}
Easplist <- tax2traits(Easplist, get_names=TRUE)
head(Easplist@taxonTraits)
```

Note that the respective parental ranks are inserted in the table
**taxonTraits**, which contains the attributes of the taxa.
In the two next command lines, we will produce a subset with only members of
the family Cyperaceae and then calculate the frequency of species per genera.

```{r}
Cype <- subset(Easplist, family == "Cyperaceae", slot="taxonTraits")
Cype_stat <- count_taxa(species ~ genus, Cype)
```

Now, we can sort them to produce a nice bar plot.

```{r genera_bar}
Cype_stat <- Cype_stat[order(Cype_stat$species_count, decreasing=TRUE), ]

par(las=2, mar=c(10,5,1,1))
with(Cype_stat, barplot(species_count, names.arg=genus,
				ylab="Number of Species"))
```
