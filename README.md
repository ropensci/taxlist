## Introduction

`taxlist` is a package designed to handle and assess taxonomic lists in
**R**, providing an object class and functions in `S4` language. The
homonymous object class `taxlist` was originally designed as a module
for taxa recorded in vegetation-plot observations (see
[`vegtable`](https://github.com/ropensci/vegtable)), but became as an
independent object with the ability of contain not only lists of species
but also synonymy, hierarchical taxonomy, and functional traits
(attributes of taxa).

The main aim of this package is to keep consistence in taxonomic lists
(a set of rules are checked by the function `validObject()`), to enable
the re-arrangement of such data, and to statistically assess functional
traits and other attributes, for instance taxonomy itself (function
`tax2traits()` set taxonomic information as trait).

While this package only includes a function for the import of taxonomic
lists from [Turboveg](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/),
almost any data source can be structured as `taxlist` object, so far the
information is imported into data frames in an R session and the
consistency rules are respected (validity).

The use of `taxlist` is recommended for people cleaning raw data before
importing it to relational databases, either in the context of taxonomic
work or biodiversity assessments. The other way around, people having
relational databases or clean and structured taxonomic lists may use
`taxlist` as recipient of this information in R sessions in order to
carry out further statistical assessments. Finally, the function
`print_name()` makes `taxlist` suitable for its implementation in
interactive documents using `rmarkdonw` and `knitr` (e.g. reports,
manuscripts and check-lists).

The structure of `taxlist` objects is inspired on the structure of data
handled by [Turboveg](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/) and
relational databases.

`taxlist` objects (see [Alvarez & Luebert
2018](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.6.e23635)).

## Installing taxlist

This package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(**CRAN**) and can be directly installed within an R-session:

``` r
install.packages("taxlist", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, the current development version is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/taxlist) and can be installed using
the package `devtools`:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/taxlist", build_vignette = TRUE)
```

A vignette is installed with this package introducing to the work with
`taxlist` and can be accessed by following command in your R-session:

``` r
vignette("taxlist-intro")
```

## Building taxlist Objects

Objects can be built step-by-step as in the following example. For it,
we will use as reference the “Ferns of Chile” (original in Spanish:
“Helechos de Chile”) by **Gunkel (1984)**. We will create an empty
`taxlist` object using the function `new()`:

``` r
library(taxlist)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'taxlist'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     levels, levels<-, print

Fern <- new("taxlist")
Fern
#> object size: 5.1 Kb 
#> validation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE 
#> 
#> number of taxon usage names: 0 
#> number of taxon concepts: 0 
#> trait entries: 0 
#> number of trait variables: 0 
#> taxon views: 0
```

Then we have to set the respective taxonomic ranks. In such case, the
levels have to be provided from the lowest to highest hierarchical
level:

``` r
levels(Fern) <- c("variety", "species", "genus")
```

For convenience, we start inserting taxa with their respective names in
a top-down direction. We will use the function `add_concept()` to add a
new taxon. Note that the arguments `TaxonName`, `AuthorName`, and
`Level` are used to provide the name of the taxon, the authority of the
name and the taxonomic rank, respectively.

``` r
Fern <- add_concept(taxlist = Fern, TaxonName = "Asplenium", AuthorName = "L.", Level = "genus")
summary(Fern, "all")
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 1 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: genus 
#> parent: none 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 1 Asplenium L. 
#> ------------------------------
```

As you see, the inserted genus got the concept ID **1** (see
`TaxonConceptID` in the previous figure). To insert a species of this
genus, we use again the function `add_concept()`, but this time we will
also provide the ID of the parent taxon with the argument `Parent`.

``` r
Fern <- add_concept(Fern,
  TaxonName = "Asplenium obliquum", AuthorName = "Forster",
  Level = "species", Parent = 1
)
summary(Fern, "Asplenium obliquum")
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 2 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: species 
#> parent: 1 Asplenium L. 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 2 Asplenium obliquum Forster 
#> ------------------------------
```

In the same way, we can add now two varieties of the inserted species:

``` r
Fern <- add_concept(Fern,
  TaxonName = c(
    "Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides",
    "Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum"
  ),
  AuthorName = c(
    "(Kunze) Espinosa",
    "(Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg"
  ),
  Level = "variety", Parent = c(2, 2)
)
```

You may have realized that the function `summary()` is applied to
provide on the one side a display of meta-information for the whole
`taxlist` object, and on the other side to show a detail of the taxa
included in the object. In the later case adding the keyword `"all"` as
second argument, the summary will show a detailed information for every
taxon included in the object.

``` r
Fern
#> object size: 6.2 Kb 
#> validation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE 
#> 
#> number of taxon usage names: 4 
#> number of taxon concepts: 4 
#> trait entries: 0 
#> number of trait variables: 0 
#> taxon views: 0 
#> 
#> concepts with parents: 3 
#> concepts with children: 2 
#> 
#> hierarchical levels:
#> genus
#>   species
#>     variety
#> 
#> number of concepts in level genus: 1
#> number of concepts in level species: 1
#> number of concepts in level variety: 2

summary(Fern, "all")
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 1 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: genus 
#> parent: none 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 1 Asplenium L. 
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 2 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: species 
#> parent: 1 Asplenium L. 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 2 Asplenium obliquum Forster 
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 3 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: variety 
#> parent: 2 Asplenium obliquum Forster 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 3 Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides (Kunze) Espinosa 
#> ------------------------------ 
#> concept ID: 4 
#> view ID: none 
#> level: variety 
#> parent: 2 Asplenium obliquum Forster 
#> 
#> # accepted name: 
#> 4 Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum (Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg 
#> ------------------------------
```

## Indented lists

A feature implemented in version 0.2.1 is the function
`indented_list()`, which provides a better display on the hierarchical
strucutre of `taxlist` objects.

``` r
indented_list(Fern)
#> Asplenium L.
#>  Asplenium obliquum Forster
#>   Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides (Kunze) Espinosa
#>   Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum (Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg
```

## From data frame to taxlist

A more convenient way is to create an object from a data frame including
both, the taxon concepts with their accepted names and the taxonomic
ranks with parent-child relationships. In the case of the last example,
the required data frame looks like this one:

``` r
Fern_df <- data.frame(
  TaxonConceptID = 1:4,
  TaxonUsageID = 1:4,
  TaxonName = c(
    "Asplenium", "Asplenium obliquum",
    "Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides",
    "Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum"
  ),
  AuthorName = c(
    "L.", "Forster", "(Kunze) Espinosa",
    "(Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg"
  ),
  Level = c("genus", "species", "variety", "variety"),
  Parent = c(NA, 1, 2, 2),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
Fern_df
#>   TaxonConceptID TaxonUsageID                              TaxonName
#> 1              1            1                              Asplenium
#> 2              2            2                     Asplenium obliquum
#> 3              3            3     Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides
#> 4              4            4 Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum
#>                                           AuthorName   Level Parent
#> 1                                                 L.   genus     NA
#> 2                                            Forster species      1
#> 3                                   (Kunze) Espinosa variety      2
#> 4 (Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg variety      2
```

This kind of tables can be written in a spreadsheet application and
imported to your R session. The two first columns correspond to the IDs
of the taxon concept and the respective accepted name. They can be
custom IDs but are restricted to integers in `taxlist`. For the use of
the function `df2taxlist()`, the two first columns are mandatory. Also
note that the column **Parent** is pointing to the concept IDs of the
respective parent taxon. To get the object, we just use the
`df2taxlist()` indicating the sequence of taxonomic ranks in the
argument `levels`.

``` r
Fern2 <- df2taxlist(Fern_df, levels = c("variety", "species", "genus"))
#> No values for 'AcceptedName' in 'x'. all names will be considered as accepted names.
Fern2
#> object size: 6.2 Kb 
#> validation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE 
#> 
#> number of taxon usage names: 4 
#> number of taxon concepts: 4 
#> trait entries: 0 
#> number of trait variables: 0 
#> taxon views: 0 
#> 
#> concepts with parents: 3 
#> concepts with children: 2 
#> 
#> hierarchical levels:
#> genus
#>   species
#>     variety
#> 
#> number of concepts in level genus: 1
#> number of concepts in level species: 1
#> number of concepts in level variety: 2
```

## Similar Packages

The package `taxlist` shares similar objectives with the package
[`taxa`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa), but uses different
approaches for object oriented programming in **R**, namely `taxlist`
applies **S4** while `taxa` uses **R6**. Additionally, `taxa` is rather
developer-oriented, while `taxlist` is rather a user-oriented package.

In following cases you may prefer to use `taxlist`:

- When you need an automatic check on the consistency of information
  regarding taxonomic ranks and parent-child relationships (parents have
  to be of a higher rank then children), as well as non-duplicated
  combinations of names and authors. Such checks are done by the
  function `validObject()`.
- When you foresee statistical assessments on taxonomy diversity or
  taxon properties (chorology, conservation status, functional traits,
  etc.).
- When you seek to produce documents using **rmarkdown**, for instance
  guide books or check-lists. Also in article manuscripts taxonomic
  names referring to a taxon concept can easily get formatted by the
  function `print_name()`.
- When importing taxonomic lists from databases stored in [**Turboveg
  2**](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/).
- When you seek to implement the package
  [`vegtable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegtable) for handling
  and assessing biodiversity records, especially vegetation-plot data.
  In that case, taxonomic lists will be formatted by `taxlist` as a slot
  within a `vegtable` object.

## Rmarkdown Integration

As mentioned before, `taxlist` objects can be also used for writing
rmarkdown documents (see [this
poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36713.90728)). For instance
you can insert your objects at the beginning of the document with a
hidden chunk:

```` markdown
```{r  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(taxlist)
data(Easplist)
```
````

To mention a taxon, you can write in-line codes, such as <code>\`r
print_name(Easplist, 206)\`</code>, which will insert *Cyperus papyrus*
L. in your document (note that the number is the ID of the taxon concept
in `Easplist`). Fort a second mention of the same species, you can then
use <code>\`r print_name(Easplist, 206, second_mention=TRUE)\`</code>,
which will insert *C. papyrus* L. in your text.

## Descriptive Statistics

Information located in the slot **taxonTraits** are suitable for
statistical assessments. For instance, in the installed object
`Easplist` a column called **life_form** includes a classification of
macrophytes into different life forms. To know the frequency of these
life forms in the `Easplist`, we can use the function `count_taxa()`:

``` r
# how man taxa in 'Easplist'
count_taxa(Easplist)
#> [1] 3887

# frequency of life forms
count_taxa(~life_form, Easplist)
#>             life_form taxa_count
#> 1    acropleustophyte          8
#> 2         chamaephyte         25
#> 3      climbing_plant         25
#> 4  facultative_annual         20
#> 5     obligate_annual        114
#> 6        phanerophyte         26
#> 7    pleustohelophyte          8
#> 8          reed_plant         14
#> 9       reptant_plant         19
#> 10      tussock_plant         52
```

Furthermore, taxonomic information can be also transferred to this slot
using the function `tax2traits()`. By this way we will make taxonomic
ranks suitable for frequency calculations.

``` r
Easplist <- tax2traits(Easplist, get_names = TRUE)
head(Easplist@taxonTraits)
#>   TaxonConceptID          life_form form variety subspecies
#> 1              7       phanerophyte <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#> 2              9       phanerophyte <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#> 3             18 facultative_annual <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#> 4             20 facultative_annual <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#> 5             21    obligate_annual <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#> 6             22        chamaephyte <NA>    <NA>       <NA>
#>                  species complex        genus        family
#> 1        Acacia mearnsii    <NA>       Acacia   Leguminosae
#> 2     Acacia polyacantha    <NA>       Acacia   Leguminosae
#> 3     Achyranthes aspera    <NA>  Achyranthes Amaranthaceae
#> 4     Acmella caulirhiza    <NA>      Acmella    Compositae
#> 5      Acmella uliginosa    <NA>      Acmella    Compositae
#> 6 Aeschynomene schimperi    <NA> Aeschynomene   Leguminosae
```

Note that the respective parental ranks are inserted in the table
**taxonTraits**, which contains the attributes of the taxa. In the two
next command lines, we will produce a subset with only members of the
family Cyperaceae and then calculate the frequency of species per
genera.

``` r
Cype <- subset(Easplist, family == "Cyperaceae", slot = "taxonTraits")
Cype_stat <- count_taxa(species ~ genus, Cype)
```

Now, we can sort them to produce a nice bar plot.

``` r
Cype_stat <- Cype_stat[order(Cype_stat$species_count, decreasing = TRUE), ]

par(las = 2, mar = c(10, 5, 1, 1))
with(Cype_stat, barplot(species_count,
  names.arg = genus,
  ylab = "Number of Species"
))
```
